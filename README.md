# Creating data table interface using plotly dash

In this project, I created an interface that retrieves data from Cassandra database in real-time and added it into the table.

I made the front-end and the back-end on python using plolty dash and other libraries.

I've made a lot of efforts to have a good performance in case we have massive data.

I've also added a login page to access to the table, you can add your own IP address, user, and password from login.py

After installing the requirement, you can run app.py, open a web page and enter the IP address (localhost address IP for example) to access the table with data from your Cassandra database or another database.
